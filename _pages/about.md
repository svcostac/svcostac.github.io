Short Bio
--------

I have experience (research staff, PhD & MSc) in distributed systems and cloud system management and exposure to data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms. I am interested in solving cloud and data science related problems.

So far I mostly focused on understanding the characteristics of cloud applications and their emerging trends, and solving issues from running them on cloud and HPC systems: performance, cost-effective resource management, resilience. My work resulted in prototypes of core-components of the cloud management systems, e.g., schedulers and workload controllers, built on open-source technologies. I also use simulation tools for prototyping and testing scheduling algorithms. 

When I have free time I usually enjoy hiking, do some mountaineering training and make plans to climb mountains: Aconcagua(6,960.8m) is on my “next trip” list.

Interests
--------

Overall, my profesional activities are in the following areas:

* **Large-scale distributed systems**

* **Cloud Computing**

* **Infrastructure for data analytics and machine learning/deep learning**

* **Scalability, reliability and performance/cost optimizations**
