I was part of Research Staff on the Container Cloud Platform at [IBM T.J.Watson Research Center](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) , (NY) US until November 2018. Before joining IBM in January 2016 I was a postdoc researcher at [Vrije University in Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl/en) (NL) and [Chalmers Technical University](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in Gothenburg (Sweden). 
I finished my graduate studies at [Politehnica University of Bucharest]() and during my Master I did an internship at INRIA in the [Myriads group](https://team.inria.fr/myriads/) in the small and lovely city of Rennes, France. The goal of the internship was to provide *high availablity* for geo-distributed services in a dynamic and large scale system. The most fun part of the project was to run my replication algorithms on large-scale academic testbeds and test them with hundreds of service instances. This motivated me to further pursue a *PhD at University of Rennes 1*, France while being lucky to frequently interact with people involved in system management for nuclear simulations at [Electricite de France](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development). The outcome of my PhD was a resource management framework for running HPC applications (batch MPI and task farming) on a private cloud that provides autmated life-cycle management and uses spot market algorithms for prioritizing and scaling application resources, as well as load-balacing and migration algorithms for resource placement.


I have aprox. 10 years of research experience in distributed systems and cloud management. I am interested in cloud technologies and issues that come from cloud hosting for applications from varied domains, e.g., life sciences, transportation, etc. In particular, my interests are in automatically managing and smartly allocating resources to a wide range of cloud (migrated or native) applications, **from high performance computing** to **data analysis** (real-time streaming and batch computations) and **machine learning/deep learning**, all with a dual objective: *maximizing the ROI of resources and providing a seamless user experience*. My work resulted in prototypes of core-components of the cloud management systems, e.g., schedulers and workload controllers, built on open-source technologies. I also used simulation tools for prototyping and testing algorithms.

Overall, my profesional activities are in the following areas:

* **Large-scale distributed systems

* **Cloud Computing

* **Infrastructure for data analytics and machine learning/deep learning

* **Scalability, reliability and performance/cost optimizations
