####Welcome to my homepage!

-I have 10 years of research experience in distributed systems and cloud management. I am interested in cloud technologies and issues that come from addressing requirements of cloud hosting for applications from other domains, e.g., life sciences, transportation, etc. In particular, my focus was automatically managing and smartly allocating resources to a wide range of cloud (migrated or native) applications, **from high performance computing** to **data analysis** (real-time streaming and batch computations) and **machine learning/deep learning**, all with a dual objective: *maximizing the ROI of used resources and providing a seamless user experience*. My work resulted in prototypes of core-components of the cloud management systems, e.g., schedulers and workload controllers, built on open-source technologies. I also used simulation tools for prototyping and testing algorithms.

-I finished my graduate studies at *Politehnica University of Bucharest* and during my Master I did an internship at INRIA in the small and lovely city of Rennes, France. The goal of the internship was to provide *high availablity* for geo-distributed services in a dynamic and large scale system. The most fun part of the project was to run my replication algorithms on large-scale academic testbeds and test them with hundreds of service instances. This motivated me to further pursue a *PhD at University of Rennes 1*, France while being lucky to have frequent interactions with people involved in system management for nuclear simulations at *Electricite de France*. The outcome of my PhD was a resource management framework for running HPC applications (batch MPI and task farming) on a private cloud using spot market and virtual economy algorithms for prioritizing and scaling application resources, as well as load-balacing and migration algorithms for resource placement. Afterwards, my work lead me to *Vrije University in Amsterdam (NL)*, *Chalmers Technical University in Gothenburg (Sweden)* and *IBM T.J.Watson Research Center, (NY) US* where I was part of Research Staff on the Container Cloud Platform.
