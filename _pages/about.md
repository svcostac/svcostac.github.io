Short Bio
--------

I am a software engineer at JPMorgan working on a distributed platform for financial risk algorithms. I have experience (research staff, PhD & MSc) in distributed systems and cloud system management and exposure to data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms. I am interested in data analytics methodologies and platforms, how they run on the Cloud, and, more recently, in their use for financial applications.

Since starting (and succesfully finishing) my PhD degree, I focused on understanding the characteristics of cloud applications and their emerging trends, and resource management mechanisms to run them in a cost-effective and performant way on cloud and HPC systems. My work resulted in prototypes of core-components of the cloud management systems, e.g., schedulers and workload controllers, built on open-source technologies. I also use simulation tools for prototyping and testing scheduling algorithms. 

When I have free time I usually enjoy a good hike and making plans for mountain climbing trips.

Some key-words to describe the areas of my work:

* **Large-scale distributed systems**

* **Cloud Computing**

* **Performance evaluation and analysis**

* **Data analytics and applied machine learning**

* **Infrastructures for data analytics and machine learning/deep learning**

* **Scalability, reliability and performance/cost optimizations**
