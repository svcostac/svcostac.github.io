Summary
------
I have aprox. 10 years of research experience in distributed systems and cloud system management and a deep understanding of the cloud software stack and the life-cycle of cloud-native applications. I am interested in understanding the characteristics of cloud applications, in particular data analytics and deep learning, and solving issues from running them on cloud and HPC systems, e.g., performance, cost-effective resource management, resilience. My work resulted in prototypes of core-components of the cloud management systems, e.g., schedulers and workload controllers, built on open-source technologies. I also used simulation tools for prototyping and testing algorithms.
